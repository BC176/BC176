ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Brian Clark.
 
I am recently graduated from Coding Dojo having learned the MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js full stack. I have also graduated Magna Cum Laude with the C# and OOP certificates from Aims Community College. The OOP certificate consisted of Java, Kotlin, and Swift. I feel like I have a well rounded education now with exposure to C#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, C++, Python, SQL, Mongoose(MongoDB), JavaScript and React, HTML and CSS, Git/GitHub, GitBash/cmd and several different IDE's. In addition, I manage two websites on a contractor basis.

I am an avid programmer who is ready to focus in on specific stacks, frameworks and libraries, technologies, and languages after being a knowledge sponge in my eclectic education and experience. My long term goal was always to return to the technology world after raising my children to the point where I could return to school. That day came, I conquered my education, and I am now ready to transition from a job to a career!
