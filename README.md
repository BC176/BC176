Hello there! I'm Brian Clark, I'll be transitioning careers here hopefully very soon into the world of software. I'm currently learning the MERN stack with Coding Dojo and am 
slated to graduate October, 2021. It's been a blast to learn with them! I decided to do a bootcamp after receiving my AAS in CiS with a focus on Object Oriented Programming.
I graduated Magna Cum Laude as well as with the C# and OOP certificates. The OOP cert consisted of Java, Kotlin, and Swift. Upon graduation and applications to several 
different jobs, I found that my data learning was on point, but the application of it, as well as building a repository, working full stack, etc, was not up to par.
This led me to the thought that learning a full stack, maybe some frameworks and libraries, would be of value in my career transition endeavors. I feel like I have a well rounded 
education now with exposure to C#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, C++, Python, a slew of networking and security classes, SQL, Mongoose(MongoDB), JavaScript and React, HTML and CSS, and 
several different IDE's. Although I lack specificity in any one language or stack, I've now proven to myself after graduating with honors from college and receiving the 
Black Belt for my Coding Dojo project pet-shelter (which can be found in my repo and uses the MERN technologies) that I can learn in short order anything that has been thrown
at me. I've indulged in as much of the extra credit portion of assignments as I could, and have enjoyed overcoming each and every learning obstacle along the way.
Sometimes I walked through the learning doors with dignity and grace, and sometimes I busted through walls like the kool-aid guy, but I always got there! I am interested, as 
probably every new developer is, in Saving The World. I would LOVE to work on projects that directly lend to the betterment of our global community. There are companies using
robotics to clean the oceans. There are companies using technology to bring sustainable farming practices to over-crowded cities. There are companies using technology to 
find ways to bring clean water, communication and connectivity, and safety features to remote villages and towns. There are technologies that support surgeons from around the 
world to perform miracles remotely. There are too many good things happening with technology to list! As the 'new guy', I know I have some time in the trenches to prove myself 
and start learning specific stacks on deeper levels, and I'm super excited to begin doing so. One day, a program I collaborate on, will be deployed to a technology that will
improve the life of others, and on that day I will celebrate!
